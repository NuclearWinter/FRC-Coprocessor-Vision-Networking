# FRC-Coprocessor-Vision-Networking
Program to send data to the roboRIO from a coprocessor running vision processing via NetworkTables. WIP

## Purpose
This program is intended to simplify running vision processing on a coprocessor. You will still have to make a few changes to get things set up for whatever you are tracking with (blobs, lines, contours), but this makes the process of setting up network tables much easier.

## Requires
OpenCV, WPILib (NetworkTables)

# This is a work in progress
