# Please Note:
My team (3926) has decided to use python for this as it is easier for us to quickly get something working on our raspberry pi. I reccomend you do the same. For some help on getting started, see <a href="https://github.com/mparobotics/2017Season">our repository</a> here on Github. I still want to work on this for the future, but at least until the season is over I probably won't be commiting.

# FRC-Coprocessor-Vision-Networking
Program to send data to the roboRIO from a coprocessor running vision processing via NetworkTables. WIP

## Purpose
This program is intended to simplify running vision processing on a coprocessor. You will still have to make a few changes to get things set up for whatever you are tracking with (blobs, lines, contours), but this makes the process of setting up network tables much easier.

## Requires
OpenCV, WPILib (NetworkTables)

# This is a work in progress
